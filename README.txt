My backend has two jobs, and both of them relate to a contact form I added to my website. It's hosted on render and has one endpoint: "https://eochis23-github-io.onrender.com". It accepts a JSON of data from a contact form that the user fills out on my site. They can either write a message and send it directly in which case render stores the message for me to view, or they can use a button to generate me a message to send with AI after they type a brief idea in the box, they can then send this message too. It returns either a completed AI-Generated message to the event listener that called the backend's function which then fills the textbox or a "message received" message depending on the button they pressed. The backend then stores the messages in it's logs because it does not support emailing me the result :( You should set up the backend on render using this repository and set the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY in render to a Gemini API key. It handles this one and only secret by storing it as a private environment variable on render.

Key Prompts:
Read this page and add a contact form to it: *Full html here*
now can you use the gemini api to include an option for the uses to have gemini write them an email from a bulleted list, show it before sending and have them send it?
